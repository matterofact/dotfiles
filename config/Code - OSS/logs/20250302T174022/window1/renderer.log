There are plenty of ways to become more proficient building containerized applications using the Docker extension.\n\nFor example, you can [debug a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/debug-common), or [run multiple containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/docker-compose) at once using Docker Compose.\n\nCheck out our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview) to make the most of the Docker extension for VS
